    <string name="info_vision"> In contemporary era of diverse religious beliefs, living styles and liberal outlooks, it becomes pertinent for systems to cater diverse groups as per their needs and justified preferences.
People from western India, Jainism and many other parts of India, particularly with a spiritual inclination, have profound researched belief system which gives much importance to food.

In Hindi, it’s said Jaisa Ann, Vaisa Mann. Sattvik aims to cater food which keeps lightness in the mind, agility in the body and is conducive for people to meditate and pursue self enquiry.

    <string name="info_history">On 26th Aug 2012, three boys were hustling room to room and were inviting hostlers at IIT for a lunch which was being served without onion and Garlic. 24 students came up and were served delicious vegetarian food without onion garlic and they loved it.
These were the first twenty four customers who registered themselves at the GRTA Apartments common room which was turned into a dining hall. People used to eat while sitting cross legged at floor and were served at their place.
Three months Later Sattvik served about 600 meals a day and there used to be long queues during lunch time as all students used to come at one particular time. Sattvik later opened its doors for girls as well and now runs into two branches catering ..... meals a day!
